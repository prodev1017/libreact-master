# Boundaries

Boundaries are components that split the element tree &mdash; its ancestors and children &mdash;
according to some semantic meaning.

- [`<BrowserOnly>`](./BrowserOnly.md) &mdash; renders children only in browser.
- [`<ServerOnly>`](./ServerOnly.md) &mdash; renders children only on server.
- [`<ElectronOnly>`](./ElectronOnly.md) &mdash; renders children only in an Electron app.
- [`<ErrorBoundary>`](./ErrorBoundary.md) &mdash; reports errors in its children.
